                <div class="dropdown__top">Why is it important to consider profitability, inventory, and product lifecycles when it comes to advertising?</div>
                <div class="dropdown__btm">
                    <p>Advertising should not operate in a solo. It’s important to understand other key aspects of your business to ensure that your advertising strategy is aligned to achieve your business objectives. For example, knowing your gross margin allows you to understand at which point advertising is profitable. Considering whether your product is brand new to market vs. already established allows you to determine whether your goal should be to optimize for profitability rather than to maximize sales, or anywhere in between. It’s also important to understand your inventory levels to ensure you never stock out and when it’s important to scale up advertising to drive sell-through for excess inventory.</p>
